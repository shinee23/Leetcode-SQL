#Question:
https://leetcode.com/problems/average-time-of-process-per-machine/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50

#Solution:
SELECT a.machine_id, ROUND(AVG(b.timestamp - a.timestamp),3) AS processing_time
FROM Activity a JOIN Activity b
ON a.machine_id = b.machine_id 
   AND a.process_id = b.process_id 
   AND a.activity_type = 'start'
   AND b.activity_type = 'end'
GROUP BY 1;

-- Group by 1 means group by machine_id in this context
